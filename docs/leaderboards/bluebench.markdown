# BlueBench Leaderboard

The [BlueBench Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ibm-research/bluebench){:target="bluebench-leaderboard"} on the [IBM Research Hugging Face Community](https://huggingface.co/ibm-research){:target="ibmr-hf"} is an easy-to-use suite of benchmarks for different domains.

From the description:

> BlueBench is an open-source benchmark developed by domain experts to represent required needs of Enterprise users. It is constructed using state-of-the-art benchmarking methodologies to ensure validity, robustness, and efficiency by utilizing [unitxtâ€™s](https://www.unitxt.ai/){:target="_blank"} abilities for dynamic and flexible text processing. As a dynamic and evolving benchmark, BlueBench currently encompasses diverse domains such as legal, finance, customer support, and news. It also evaluates a range of capabilities, including RAG, pro-social behavior, summarization, and ChatBot performance, with additional tasks and domains to be integrated over time.

## Using BlueBench for Your Own Evaluations

BlueBench is particularly easy to run locally, with just a few commands. See the _Reproducibility_ section at the end of the _About_ tab on the [leaderboard page](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ibm-research/bluebench){:target="bluebench-leaderboard"}.
