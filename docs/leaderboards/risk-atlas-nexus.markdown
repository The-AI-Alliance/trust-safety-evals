# Risk Atlas Nexus

The [Risk Atlas Nexus](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ibm/risk-atlas-nexus){:target="ran"} on the [IBM Hugging Face Community](https://huggingface.co/ibm){:target="ibm-hf"} provides a query prompt to search for risk categories that are most relevant. The user can then browse for more details on each category.

From the website:

{: .important}
> [Risk Atlas Nexus](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ibm/risk-atlas-nexus){:target="ran"} aims to provide tooling to help bring together disparate resources related to governance of foundation models. We support a community driven approach to curating and cataloguing resources such as datasets, benchmarks and mitigations. Our goal is to turn abstract risk definitions into actionable workflows that streamline AI governance processes. By connecting fragmented resources, Risk Atlas Nexus seeks to fill a critical gap in AI governance, enabling stakeholders to build more robust, transparent, and accountable systems. Risk Atlas Nexus builds on the [IBM AI Risk Atlas](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=ai-risk-atlas){:target="ara-watsonx"} making this educational resource a nexus of governance assets and tooling. An AI System's Knowledge Graph is used to provide a unified structure that links and contextualizes the very heterogeneous domain data.
> 
> Our intention is to create a starting point for an open AI Systems ontology whose focus is on risk and that the community can extend and enhance. This ontology serves as the foundation that unifies innovation and tooling in the AI risk space. By lowering the barrier to entry for developers, it fosters a governance-first approach to AI solutions, while also inviting the broader community to contribute their own tools and methodologies to expand its impact.

## Working with the Risk Atlas Nexus Code
