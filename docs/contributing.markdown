# Join This Initiative!

Want to join one of our initiative projects? Visit [this AI Alliance webpage](https://thealliance.ai/working-groups/trust-safety#trust-and-safety-form){:target="join-us-form"} and fill in the form. Thank you for your interest.

We welcome your contributions for cataloging existing evaluations and benchmarks, and for creating new ones. Improving our leaderboards and creating new ones is important for our mission of making evaluations accessible and as widely used as possible. Visit the initiative's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals/){:target="repo"} to see what tools and leaderboards are already implemented. See the [issues](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals/issues){:target="repo"} and the [work tracking project](https://github.com/orgs/The-AI-Alliance/projects/23/views/1){:target="repo-project"}. 

Here is the project dashboard filtered by _labels_ for the main work streams:

* [evaluations](https://github.com/orgs/The-AI-Alliance/projects/23/views/1?filterQuery=label%3Aevaluations){:target="evaluations"} and building a [taxonomy](https://github.com/orgs/The-AI-Alliance/projects/23/views/1?filterQuery=label%3Ataxonomy){:target="taxonomy"}
* [leaderboards](https://github.com/orgs/The-AI-Alliance/projects/23/views/1?filterQuery=label%3Aleaderboards){:target="leaderboards"}

See also the companion projects, [Evaluation Reference Stack](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/eval-ref-stack/){:target="ers"} and [Testing Generative AI Applications](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/ai-application-testing/){:target="tgai"}, for related work.

The repo [README](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals){:target="repo"} explains more details for contributors, such as our "DCO" requirements, which you should understand first.

# Making Smaller Contributions

You may not have the time or the expertise to be extensively involved, but you can easily make suggestions for small improvements. Contributing changes as [pull requests](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals/pulls){:target="repo"} is the best, welcome way to contribute. Alternatively, consider [posting issues](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals/issues){:target="repo"}. (Browsing the issues is also a good place to find out where help is needed!) 

For this documentation website itself, if you are interested in contributing to it, the sources are in the GitHub repo's [`docs`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals/tree/main/docs){:target="repo-docs"} directory. 

Notice that every page on this website has _Edit this page on GitHub_ links, making it easy to view a page, then go straight to the source to make edits and submit a PR. This is the best way to help us fix typos and make other small improvements.

Finally, we welcome suggestions and feedback via [email](mailto:contact@thealliance.ai). Be sure to mention this particular initiative, as we have many AI Alliance projects.
